1. Dataset Loading and Exploration

    Load the Dataset: Reads a CSV file containing Netflix titles data into a pandas DataFrame.
    Preview Data: Displays the first few rows and general information about the dataset, such as column names, data types, and non-null counts.

2. Data Cleaning

    Identify Missing Values: Checks for and counts missing values in each column.
    Handle Missing Values:
        Drops rows where essential columns (title, type) have missing values.
        Fills missing values in director, cast, country, date_added, and rating columns with appropriate placeholders (e.g., 'Unknown').
        Drops rows where duration is missing.
    Display Cleaned Data: Shows the updated DataFrame structure and some of the cleaned data.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Content Type Distribution: Visualizes the distribution of content types (Movies vs. TV Shows) using a count plot.
    Content Over Time: Plots the number of movies and TV shows added over the years.
    Top Countries: Displays a bar chart of the top 10 countries with the most content.
    Word Cloud: Creates a word cloud of genres to visualize the frequency of different genres.
    Movie Duration: Shows the distribution of movie durations using a histogram.
    TV Show Seasons: Visualizes the distribution of the number of seasons for TV shows.
    Top Directors: Plots the top 10 most frequent directors.
    Content Ratings: Displays the distribution of content ratings.
    Top Genres: Visualizes the top 10 genres.
    Content Type Over Years: Shows how the distribution of content types has changed over the years.
    Content by Country: Illustrates the distribution of content types by country for the top 10 countries.

4. Content-Based Filtering

    Combine Content Information: Merges description and listed_in into a single content column for a content-based recommendation approach.
    TF-IDF Vectorization: Transforms the content column into a TF-IDF matrix, which reflects the importance of words in each document relative to the entire corpus.
    Cosine Similarity Calculation: Computes the cosine similarity between content vectors to measure similarity between items.
    Recommendation Function: Defines a function get_recommendations that returns a list of recommended titles based on a given title’s content similarity.

5. Advanced Recommendation System (Collaborative Filtering)

    Generate User Ratings: Creates a synthetic dataset of user ratings for collaborative filtering purposes, assuming random user IDs and ratings.
    Load Data into Surprise Library: Prepares the data for collaborative filtering using the Surprise Library.
    Train SVD Model: Uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for matrix factorization to build a collaborative filtering model.
    Evaluate Model: Performs cross-validation to evaluate the model’s performance using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
    Recommendation Function: Defines recommend_top_n, a function that recommends top-N items for a given user based on the collaborative filtering model.

6. Testing the Recommendation Systems

    Content-Based Recommendations: Tests the recommendation system with specific titles such as 'Blood & Water', 'Ganglands', and 'My Little Pony: A New Generation' to check the relevance of recommendations.
    Collaborative Filtering Recommendations: Tests the collaborative filtering model to suggest top-N items for a specific user ID.

Summary

    Dataset Preparation: Clean and prepare the Netflix dataset for analysis.
    Exploratory Analysis: Visualize and analyze content distributions and characteristics.
    Content-Based Filtering: Build and test a recommendation system based on content similarity.
    Collaborative Filtering: Implement and test an advanced recommendation system based on user-item interactions.

This project provides a comprehensive approach to building and evaluating recommendation systems using both content-based and collaborative filtering methods.
